what if i do a pass with no context window?
there should be no chaos???

Universal Necessary Conditions for Chaos
1. Nonlinearity
Finite-dimensional linear systems are never chaotic; for a dynamical system to display chaotic behavior, it must be either nonlinear or infinite-dimensional Chaos theory - Wikipedia. This is absolute - no linear finite-dimensional system can be chaotic.
2. Stretching and Folding Mechanism
Chaotic behavior results from the interplay of two geometrical mechanisms: stretching, that separates close trajectories, and folding (or more generally squeezing), that maintains them at finite distance (PDF) The Topology of Deterministic Chaos: Stretching, Squeezing and Linking. This is the fundamental geometric mechanism:

Stretching: Creates sensitive dependence by exponentially separating nearby trajectories
Folding: Keeps trajectories bounded and creates mixing

System-Specific Requirements
Continuous-Time Systems (ODEs):

Minimum 3 dimensions (Poincaré-Bendixson theorem)
Nonlinear coupling between variables (your original intuition was correct)
Dissipation (for bounded attractors) or energy conservation (for conservative chaos)

Discrete Systems (Maps):

Can be chaotic in 1 dimension (logistic map)
Only need nonlinearity
The iteration process itself provides the "folding"

Mathematical Implementation
The stretching-folding is mathematically realized through:

Hyperbolic behavior: The derivative of f stretches tangent vectors which are parallel Smale horseshoe - Scholarpedia to unstable directions and contracts along stable directions
Transverse homoclinic intersections: Transverse homoclinicity ⇒ horseshoe ⇒ chaos Smale horseshoe - Scholarpedia

Bottom Line
Your feedback intuition was correct but incomplete. The complete answer is: nonlinear coupling that creates stretching and folding. The nonlinearity enables the stretching (exponential divergence), while the system's bounded nature forces folding. Together, these create the geometric template for chaos.
This is why chaos requires nonlinear terms that couple variables - they create the stretch-fold dynamics that define chaotic behavior at the most fundamental level.


---------------------------

Reason behind exponential divergence. could decoding and sampling, break the exponential chain and make it sub-exponential

----------
can we show foldnig and stretching from the LLM architecture and weight matrices

----------------------
- LLMs being highly sensitive to initial conditions can imply that numerical errors, floating point precision could induce sufficient disturbances to generate a diverging inference

----------------------

for the library metrics, then check what internal distance metric they use



devaney's definition chaos


attractors, lowdim manifolds in the space
pca dim, etc might be low bc the folding and stretching make a low dim attractor. also maybe there are only few positive lyapunov exponents (degrees of freedom for chaos)






sliding windows


Of course. Based on the source code in src/metrics, here is a detailed explanation of how the sliding window
   is implemented for each metric.

  You are correct in your understanding. There are two main categories of metrics:


   1. Metrics that produce a timeseries naturally: These compute a scalar distance for each pair of vectors at
      corresponding time steps (e.g., cos). They don't strictly need a sliding window to produce a timeseries,
      but may use related concepts like shifting.
   2. Metrics that produce a single scalar: These compute one distance value for two entire trajectories (e.g.,
       dtw, hausdorff). For these, a sliding window is necessary to generate a timeseries, where each point in
      the series represents the metric calculated over a sub-portion (window) of the original trajectories.

  Here is the breakdown for each metric:

  1. cos (Cosine Distance)


   * Sliding Window: This metric does not use the global sliding_window configuration. It has its own logic
     based on a shifts parameter defined in config.py under metrics.cos.
   * How it works: It's a vector-vs-vector comparison. It calculates the cosine distance between a[t] and b[t]
      for all t. It repeats this calculation for different versions of b that have been shifted forward or
     backward in time.
   * Window Type: It is not a window of vectors. It is a global shift of one entire trajectory relative to the
      other. For a shift of 1, it compares a[0] to b[1], a[1] to b[2], and so on.
   * Pooling: After calculating the distance timeseries for every value in shifts, it aggregates them. For
     each time step, it takes all the calculated distances (one from each shift) and combines them using
     either np.nanmin (the default) or np.nanmean, as specified by shift_aggregation in the config.

  2. cos_sim (Cosine Similarity)


   * Sliding Window: Yes, this metric uses the global sliding_window configuration.
   * How it works: This is a vector-vs-window comparison. The centric_mode in the config determines the exact
     behavior:
       * centric_mode: "a" (default): It takes a single vector from trajectory a at a[start] and compares it to
         an entire window of vectors in trajectory b, b[start : start + window_size].
       * centric_mode: "b": It does the reverse, comparing b[start] to a window in a.
   * Window Type: It uses a forward window, [start : start + window_size].
   * Pooling: This metric uses two levels of pooling:
       1. Inner Pooling (within the window): It calculates the cosine similarity of the single vector against
          all vectors in the opposing window. These similarities are then aggregated into one value for the
          window. The window_agg config controls this: "mean" takes the average similarity, while "min" finds
          the maximum similarity (which corresponds to the minimum distance).
       2. Outer Pooling (if `centric_mode` is "both"): If enabled, it computes both "a"-centric and "b"-centric
           distances and then combines the two resulting timeseries using either a mean or min operation,
          controlled by centric_agg.


  3. dtw_fast (Dynamic Time Warping), frechet, hausdorff, rank_eigen, and wasserstein

  These metrics all follow the same fundamental sliding window pattern.


   * Sliding Window: Yes, they all use the global sliding_window configuration.
   * How it works: They all perform a window-vs-window comparison.
   * Window Type: They use a forward window, taking a slice [start : start + window_size] from both
     trajectories (a and b) simultaneously.
   * Comparison and Pooling:
       * `dtw_fast` & `frechet`: The fastdtw or _discrete_frechet function is called on the two windowed
         sub-trajectories (wa, wb). The function itself performs a complex alignment and returns a single
         scalar distance for that pair of windows. This scalar becomes the next value in the output
         timeseries.
       * `wasserstein`: It takes the two windows (window_a, window_b), flattens them into 1D distributions of
         values, and computes the wasserstein_distance between them, which yields a single scalar.
       * `rank_eigen`: It performs PCA on each window (w1, w2) to get eigenvectors. It then computes a
         deviation metric between these sets of eigenvectors, resulting in a single scalar for the window
         pair.
       * `hausdorff`: This one has an extra pooling step. After taking the two windows (wa, wb), it calculates
          the nearest-neighbor distances for all points within the windows. It then aggregates these distances
          into a single scalar for the window pair using the method specified in metrics.hausdorff.aggregation
          ("max_of_mean" or "mean_of_max").

  4. cross_corr (Cross Correlation)


   * Sliding Window: Yes, it uses the global sliding_window configuration, but in a unique way.
   * How it works: This is a window-vs-window comparison on pre-computed matrices.
       1. First, it computes a full (T, T) cosine similarity matrix for trajectory a and another for trajectory
           b.
       2. Then, it slides a square window [start:end, start:end] over both of these similarity matrices.
   * Pooling: For each pair of windowed sub-matrices, it flattens them into 1D vectors and computes a single
     correlation coefficient (pearsonr or spearmanr) between them. This single scalar becomes the value in the
     output timeseries.


  5. cross_cos (Cross Cosine)


   * Sliding Window: This metric's implementation is highly specialized.
   * How it works: It does not slide a window over the original trajectories in the typical way.
       1. It first computes a full (Ta, Tb) cross-similarity matrix between a and b.
       2. The "sliding window" is then applied to the rows of this matrix to generate the timeseries. For each
          column j, it creates a centered window of rows around j ([j - half: j + half]).
   * Pooling: For each column j, it calculates the nansum of the values within that column's corresponding
     row-window. This sum is the value for the output timeseries at that position. It is not comparing windows
     of trajectories, but rather aggregating a pre-computed cross-similarity matrix in a windowed fashion.

> also explain for the rest of metrics (Metrics that produce a single scalar). if some metrics implement it
  identically, then say so

✦ You are right to ask for clarification on the other metrics. The ones that compute a single scalar for
  entire trajectories are precisely the ones that rely on the sliding window mechanism to generate a
  timeseries.

  Here is the explanation for them.


  Identical Implementations: dtw_fast, frechet, wasserstein, and rank_eigen

  The implementation of the sliding window for these four metrics is identical in its structure.


   1. Governing Config: They all use the global sliding_window configuration from config.py (use_window,
      window_size, displacement).

   2. Window Type: They use a forward window. For each step, the code takes a slice [start : start +
      window_size] from both trajectory a and trajectory b.


   3. Comparison: The comparison is strictly window-vs-window. The sub-trajectory from a is compared only with
      the corresponding sub-trajectory from b.


   4. Pooling: For these metrics, the core distance function (e.g., fastdtw, _discrete_frechet,
      wasserstein_distance) is called on the two windowed sub-trajectories. This function, by its nature,
      performs a complex internal calculation and boils the comparison down to a single scalar distance for
      that window pair. This single scalar directly becomes the next point in the output timeseries. There is
      no additional pooling layer like mean or min applied by the sliding window logic itself.


       * Example (`dtw_fast`): At start = 0, it computes the DTW distance between a[0:16] and b[0:16]. The
         resulting scalar (e.g., 12.3) is the first point in the timeseries. At start = 1, it computes the DTW
          distance between a[1:17] and b[1:17], and that scalar is the second point.

  hausdorff


  The hausdorff metric follows the exact same structural pattern as the group above (window-vs-window
  comparison using a forward window). The only difference is a specific pooling step that happens inside the
   window comparison.


   1. Windowing: It takes a window wa from trajectory a and wb from trajectory b, just like the others.
   2. Internal Pooling: Before a single scalar can be produced, it performs an intermediate calculation. It
      finds the nearest-neighbor distance for every point in wa to the set wb, and vice-versa. This results in
      two lists of distances.
   3. Final Pooling: It then aggregates these two lists into a single scalar for the window using the method
      specified in config.py (metrics.hausdorff.aggregation), which is either "max_of_mean" or "mean_of_max".
      This final scalar becomes the point in the output timeseries.


  So, while it shares the same windowing scheme, it has an explicit, configurable pooling step that the
  other metrics in this category do not.
