Universal Necessary Conditions for Chaos
1. Nonlinearity
Finite-dimensional linear systems are never chaotic; for a dynamical system to display chaotic behavior, it must be either nonlinear or infinite-dimensional Chaos theory - Wikipedia. This is absolute - no linear finite-dimensional system can be chaotic.
2. Stretching and Folding Mechanism
Chaotic behavior results from the interplay of two geometrical mechanisms: stretching, that separates close trajectories, and folding (or more generally squeezing), that maintains them at finite distance (PDF) The Topology of Deterministic Chaos: Stretching, Squeezing and Linking. This is the fundamental geometric mechanism:

Stretching: Creates sensitive dependence by exponentially separating nearby trajectories
Folding: Keeps trajectories bounded and creates mixing

System-Specific Requirements
Continuous-Time Systems (ODEs):

Minimum 3 dimensions (Poincaré-Bendixson theorem)
Nonlinear coupling between variables (your original intuition was correct)
Dissipation (for bounded attractors) or energy conservation (for conservative chaos)

Discrete Systems (Maps):

Can be chaotic in 1 dimension (logistic map)
Only need nonlinearity
The iteration process itself provides the "folding"

Mathematical Implementation
The stretching-folding is mathematically realized through:

Hyperbolic behavior: The derivative of f stretches tangent vectors which are parallel Smale horseshoe - Scholarpedia to unstable directions and contracts along stable directions
Transverse homoclinic intersections: Transverse homoclinicity ⇒ horseshoe ⇒ chaos Smale horseshoe - Scholarpedia

Bottom Line
Your feedback intuition was correct but incomplete. The complete answer is: nonlinear coupling that creates stretching and folding. The nonlinearity enables the stretching (exponential divergence), while the system's bounded nature forces folding. Together, these create the geometric template for chaos.
This is why chaos requires nonlinear terms that couple variables - they create the stretch-fold dynamics that define chaotic behavior at the most fundamental level.

Reason behind exponential divergence. could decoding and sampling, break the exponential chain and make it sub-exponential

for the library metrics, then check what internal distance metric they use
