\begin{abstract}
    Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet their internal dynamics remain poorly understood. In this work, we apply the tools of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory to LLMs. By analyzing both text and hidden state trajectories, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit hallmark signatures of chaos, including sensitivity to initial conditions and a positive maximum Lyapunov exponent, with consistent results across different distance metrics. Recurrence plots show structural similarities between LLMs and canonical chaotic systems such as the Lorenz attractor, while dimension analysis reveals fractal structures in the hidden state space, particularly pronounced in the last layers. We propose that the nonlinear coupling induced by attention mechanisms plays a key role in driving this chaotic behavior.

\section{Introduction and Motivation}

% G: This paragraph wants to say: Mathematicians study silly nonlinear diff eqs for fun. LLMs are even more interesting.
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), such as LLMs, are highly nonlinear systems whose parameters are not explicitly determined, but rather they are determined by training on huge sets of data.
% but rather they are trained on large sets of data. 
This allows these models to learn huge amounts of knowledge with little human intervention, which allows for scaling at the cost of interpretability.
DNNs provide a fascinating case study for nonlinear dynamics.
% Studying these systems is extremely interesting

There is growing interest in the sensitivity of LLMs (and other generative deep neural networks) to initial conditions and small perturbations. For some applications, like Reinforcement Learning (RL), determinism and reproducibility are desireable in order to keep the RL on-policy, while for other uses like synthetic data generation, paraphrasing, and novel image generation, diversity and divergence is desired.
% Understanding fixed/stable points in LLMs can clarify their generative capability constraints.
% G: needs a more natural phrasing, not forcing it into the SIC chaos direction until the end
% G: also divergence is kind of off-topic

% G: I want to say: LLMs are trained on all human data. what they learn is representative of human civilization (if we consider the written data is). more insights into LLMs is insights into us. maybe read motivation for some interpretability articles
% G: but this is not so much within the scope of this study
Given that LLMs are trained of a large corpus of human data, what they know says a lot about humanity (at least what is captured in text). Improving our understanding of the inner representations of LLMs yields insights about us.

% G: also these tools can be applied to other DNNs that handle audio image video

Much research interest has been placed on interpretability, understanding how LLMs learn and store facts
LLMs are not created, they are grown and trained
Interpretability focuses on completely understanding small components (called circuits) and their patters and behaviours in neural networks, and we believe the tools from chaos theory can help shed light into these processes \cite{olah2020zoom} \cite{ameisen2025circuit} \cite{lindsey2025biology}.

Working with LLMs presents some challenges, such as the discrete nature of tokens and their hidden state representations, and the high dimensionality of the embedding space. We 
% G: add more challenges

\section{Related Work}

% This section briefly summarizes the main results from other papers which inspired my analysis and also explain some of the results obtained. It also should reinforce the idea that it's justifiable to treat LLMs and chaotic nonlinear systems. 

The application of dynamical systems theory to neural networks has revealed complex behaviors in these models.  

\paragraph{Chaotic Dynamics in LLMs:}

\ref{li2025cognitive_activation} proposes that LLMs' reasoning capabilities as chaotic processes of dynamic information extraction in parameter space, introducing Quasi-Lyapunov Exponents to quantify chaotic characteristics across model layers, and showing sensitivity to initial conditions.

\paragraph{Attention Mechanisms and Nonlinear Dynamics:}
\ref{geshkovski2025mathematicalperspectivetransformers} model self-attention as a nonlinear coupling between tokens.
\ref{poc-lopez2024dynamical_mean_field_self_attention} demonstrate that even simplified self-attention transformer networks with 1-bit tokens and weights exhibit nontrivial dynamical phenomena, including nonequilibrium phase transitions and chaotic bifurcations. 

\paragraph{Determinism and Attractors in Language Models:}
% The tension between reproducibility and novely in LLMs has become increasingly relevant. 
\ref{he2025nondeterminism} (GGG)
Recent engineering efforts have focused on achieving deterministic inference by controlling GPU batching variance and floating-point errors, motivated by the need for reproducibility and clear signals in reinforcement learning training. 
 %Knowing the LLMs sensitivity to disturbances is important for this.
 %This highlights the practical sensitivity of LLMs to small numerical perturbations. 

\ref{wang2025unveiling_attractor_cycles} show that LLMs used for paraphrasing converge to periodic attractor cycles, reducing linguistic diversity.

\ref{cyclegan} % Comment: PLOS Complex Systems article - 
demonstrate that CycleGAN image generators' space is more limited than the training data's with Positive Lyapunov exponents and attractor dimensions similar to the training data intrinsic dimension. Chaotic dynamics contribute to the diversity of the generated images.
%This suggests that generative models may naturally converge to stable configurations that reduce output diversity. 
% G: this is a bit contradictory bc I say that model generation: more limited than training data but chaotic makes more diverse.

\paragraph{Interpretability Through Dynamical Analysis:}
%The dynamical systems perspective has proven valuable for understanding recurrent architectures. 
\ref{sussillo2013} showed that fixed points and linearized dynamics in trained RNNs provide interpretable insights into network function. \ref{zhang2024intelligence_edge_of_chaos} found that intelligence emerges at an optimal complexity level. Systems that are either highly chaotic or perfectly periodic exhibit poor downstream performance, suggesting a "sweet spot" conducive to intelligent behavior at the edge between order and chaos. \ref{zhou2025geometryreasoningflowinglogics} show how LLM's chain-of-thought reasoning can be interpreted as smooth flows in embedding space, where logical sttements control the flow's velocities.

% normalization layers
\ref{tomihari2025recurrent_self_attention_dynamics} show that normalization layers normallize Jacobian's complex eigenvalues bringing the dynamics close to a critical state with maximum Lyapunov exponents close to zero, suggesting operation at the edge of chaos: a critical regime where signals neither explode nor vanish, enabling long-range information propagation.
% G: this can explain if the trajectories have sub-exponential divergence
%show that normalization layers effectively suppress the Jacobian's spectral norm and control oscillatory behaviors. Their empirical findings reveal that high-performance self-attention models exhibit maximum Lyapunov exponents close to zero, suggesting operation at the edge of chaos—a critical regime where signals neither explode nor vanish, enabling long-range information propagation.






\section{Preliminaries}

% This section describes the background knowledge required to understand Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos, LLMs, and their similarities and differences. This provides us with the starting point for this paper.

\subsection{Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos}

- Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos
-- Definition. determinism. Trajectories in Phase Space. numerical solution.
-- differential equations and iterated maps
-- importance of nonlinearity

% <start very bad>. todo: I want this rewritten. do not mention "uniquely determined by its current state", do not emphasize ODEs so much (but mention that they can be described with differential equations or iterated maps). use the list above for things that must be mentioned
A deterministic dynamical system is one whose future evolution is uniquely determined by its current state (GGG but in LLMs it also depends on previous tokens within context window). Such systems are often modeled by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = f(\mathbf{x}(t))
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{x}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the state vector in an $n$-dimensional phase space, and $f$ is a nonlinear function. The sequence of states over time, $\mathbf{x}(t)$, traces a path known as a trajectory in this phase space.
% <end very bad>


Chaotic systems are a subclass of deterministic nonlinear systems that exhibit complex and practically unpredictable behavior. This apparent randomness arises not from a stochastic nature, but from the system's intrinsic dynamics. The defining characteristics of chaos are non-periodicity and sensitivity to initial conditions (SIC). This property implies that trajectories originating from infinitesimally close initial states, say $\mathbf{x}(0)$ and $\mathbf{x}(0) + \bm{\delta}(0)$, will diverge exponentially over time. The separation distance $\|\bm{\delta}(t)\|$ grows according to:
\begin{equation}
    \|\bm{\delta}(t)\| \approx \|\bm{\delta}(0)\| e^{\lambda t}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the maximal Lyapunov exponent. A positive maximal Lyapunov exponent is a strong indicator of chaos. It signifies that any measurement error or uncertainty in the initial state, no matter how small, will be amplified exponentially, making long-term prediction impossible.

Despite their unpredictability, the trajectories of dissipative chaotic systems are not random; often they are confined to a bounded, lower dimensional subset of phase space, a \textbf{strange attractor}, towards which all close trajectories get asymptotically attracted but without having a periodic motion \footnote{In general if a map contracts volumes in phase space it is called dissipative. A physical system with friction is an example. In contrast, conservative systems cannot have strange attractors, because attractors attract all trajectories in a small open set containing it, which contracts the volume}.
%\footnote{The 'strangeness' partly comes from the fact that trajectories diverge exponentially but remain confined in a zero-volume subset of the phase space. The explanation for this is that they diverge in the direction parallel to the attractor and get attracted in the direction orthogonal to it. GGG}.
These attractors often possess a complex, self-similar fractal structure of non-integer dimension. A common measure is the \textbf{correlation dimension ($D_2$)}. It is based on the correlation integral, $C(\epsilon)$, which measures the probability that two points on the attractor are closer than a distance $\epsilon$. For small $\epsilon$, the correlation integral scales as a power law:
\begin{equation}
    C(\epsilon) = \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{2}{N(N-1)} \sum_{i<j} \Theta(\epsilon - \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j\|) \sim \epsilon^{D_2}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of points on the trajectory and $\Theta$ is the Heaviside step function. The dimension $D_2$ is then found as the slope of the linear region in a log-log plot of $C(\epsilon)$ versus $\epsilon$.

Another powerful tool for analyzing dynamical systems is \textbf{Recurrence Analysis} \cite{MARWAN2007237}. A Recurrence Plot (RP) visualizes the times at which a trajectory revisits a previously visited neighborhood in phase space, within a threshold $\epsilon$. The recurrence matrix is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    % R_{i,j}(\epsilon) = \Theta(\epsilon - \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j\|), \quad i,j = 1, \dots, N
    R_{i,j}(\epsilon) = \Theta(\epsilon - Distance(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j)), \quad i,j = 1, \dots, N
    where \Theta is the heavyside function 
\end{equation}
% GGG: check equation 
The visual patterns in a RP provide deep insight: periodic systems produce long, parallel diagonal lines, random systems produce a uniform, noisy plot, and chaotic systems produce a complex geometric structure with short, interrupted diagonal lines. These structures can be quantified using Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA).

% G: I would like to generally describe the necessary conditions for chaos. (I dont mean SIC and exponential divergence, but rather the underlying characteristics of the system which will make it be chaotic). Then I'd like to explain which components of LLM architecture correspond to these. example: nonlinear coupling and attention

In general, the following structural conditions of a system cause it to be chaotic:
Nonlinearity: % GGG
Stretching and Folding mechanism: Stretching separates close trajectories, causing SIC. this is quantified by the lyapunov exponent. folding confines them to a bounded subset of the state space, a strange attractor.

\subsection{Large Language Models (LLMs)}
Large Language Models are a class of deep neural networks, typically using the Transformer architecture. They are trained on massive text data to predict the probability distribution for the next token in a sequence. They are used autoregressively to generate a text output sequentially by sampling from that distribution.

The process begins with tokenization, where input text is broken down into a sequence of integers (tokens). Each token is then mapped to a high-dimensional vector, its embedding. These embeddings are processed through a stack of Transformer layers. Each layer is primarily composed of two sub-modules: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise feed-forward network called Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The self-attention mechanism is the key source of nonlinearity and contextual understanding, allowing the model to dynamically weigh the importance of all other tokens in the context window, and then update the representation of a single token. It can be expressed as \cite{attention}:
% G: somewhere I could be more precise on what first layer and last layer refers to and entails, so that later in results it is more clear. maybe in method explain that i extract the hidden states after each transformers 
\begin{equation}
    \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
\end{equation}
% TODO: explain what each variable is. concise. definition + intuition. also show how it updates the hidden states
In LLMs causal masking is used to ensure that a token is only influenced by previous (and not future) tokens during attention. Due to the compute cost of attention, which grows with the square of the sequence length, attention is only performed on a sliding context window \footnote{Attention is performed on the minimum value between the sequence length and the context window size} with the latest token at its right endpoint.
This operation creates a nonlinear feedback and coupling mechanism between all elements of the sequence. The MLP further processes these representations through additional nonlinear transformations. Normalization is (GGG). 
% The output of the final layer is a sequence of hidden states, which represent the contextualized meaning of each token. % G: clarify that for all layers we can get it and also connect it better to how the logits are obtained

During inference, the LLM generates tokens autoregressively, which can be viewed as a discrete-time dynamical system:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{s}_{t+1} = f(\mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{s}_{t-1}, ..., \mathbf{s}_0) % G: maybe it should be \mathbf{s}_{t-context_window_size} to be more precise
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{s}_t$ represents the model's internal state (the sequence of hidden states) at step $t$. To generate the next token, the hidden state of the last token is passed through a final linear layer (the "un-embedding") to produce logits over the entire vocabulary, which are then converted to a probability distribution via a softmax function. A decoding strategy is then used to select a token. \textbf{Greedy sampling} deterministically selects the token with the highest probability. In contrast, \textbf{probabilistic sampling} introduces stochasticity, often controlled by a temperature parameter ($T$). Higher temperatures flatten the distribution, making the output more diverse.

\subsection{Layer normalization}
% G: mention other normalizations? like batch?
Layer normalization (LayerNorm) acts on a single hidden state vector \(h\in\mathbb{R}^d\) (e.g. a token embedding) by (i) mean-centering, (ii) variance normalization, and (iii) a learned affine anisotropic rescaling.
\begin{align}
\mu(h) &\;=\; \frac{1}{d}\sum_{i=1}^d h_i, \\
\sigma^2(h) &\;=\; \frac{1}{d}\sum_{i=1}^d (h_i-\mu(h))^2, \\
\widehat{h} &\;=\; \frac{h - \mu(h)\mathbf{1}}{\sqrt{\sigma^2(h)+\varepsilon}}, \label{eq:ln_norm}\\
y &\;=\; \gamma \odot \widehat{h} + \beta \;=\; D\widehat{h} + \beta, \label{eq:ln_affine}
\end{align}
where \(\mathbf{1}=(1,\dots,1)^\top , \gamma, \beta \in\mathbb{R}^d\), and \(D=\operatorname{diag}(\gamma)\).
% G: pretty unreadable. 
% G: benefits:
% Introducing a normalization of the hidden states after every operation as part of the model architecture made th training between 4 and 20 times faster \cite{loshchilov2025ngptnormalizedtransformerrepresentation}
% Representation learning on the hypersphere leads to more stable training, greater embedding space separability, and better performance on downstream tasks \cite{wang2022understandingcontrastiverepresentationlearning}
% Normalization techniques are beneficial \cite{salimans2016weightnormalizationsimplereparameterization}

% G: maybe we can hypothesize whether norm keeps the model more stable by limiting lyapunov exponents and keeping it at the edge of chaos

\begin{itemize}
  \item \(h\in\mathbb{R}^d\): input hidden state (one token, one sample).
  \item \(\mu(h)\): coordinate mean of \(h\)
  \item \(\sigma^2(h)\): empirical coordinate variance of \(h\)
  %\item \(\widehat{h}\): normalized (zero-mean, unit-variance) vector
  \item \(\gamma\in\mathbb{R}^d\) (or \(D=\mathrm{diag}(\gamma)\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\)): per-coordinate learned scale (anisotropic linear part)
  \item \(\beta\in\mathbb{R}^d\): learned bias
  \item \(\varepsilon\): numerical stabilizer
\end{itemize}

% todo: eliminate this paragraphs thing, just make it text with the same style as the rest of the paper
\paragraph{Geometric remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The centering step \(h\mapsto h-\mu(h)\mathbf{1}\) projects onto the hyperplane orthogonal to \(\mathbf1\) (removes the mean direction).
  \item The variance normalization (\ref{eq:ln_norm}) is nonlinear and couples all coordinates: it maps each centered vector to a point on a sphere:
  \[
    \lVert \widehat{h}\rVert_2 = \sqrt{d}.
  \]
  Thus, before the affine step the image lies on the \((d-2)\)-sphere inside the mean-zero hyperplane (degree-of-freedom count: \(d\to d-2\)).
  \item The affine step \(y=D\widehat{h}+\beta\) turns the sphere into an ellipsoid (and then translates it); \(D\) rescales coordinate axes independently and does not introduce coordinate mixing.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Jacobian (local linearization)}
Let \(u(h):=h-\mu(h)\mathbf1\) and \(\|u\|=\sqrt{u^\top u}\).  A convenient form of the Jacobian of the normalization map \(\widehat{h}(h)\) is
\[
J_{\widehat{h}}(h)
\;=\;
\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\|u\|}\,\Big(I - \frac{u u^\top}{\|u\|^2}\Big)\Big(I - \frac{1}{d}\mathbf1\mathbf1^\top\Big),
\]
and the full LayerNorm Jacobian (including \(D\)) is \(J_y(h)=D\,J_{\widehat{h}}(h)\).  For generic \(h\) (with \(d>2\)) this linearization has rank \(d-2\): two null directions correspond to the mean direction \(\mathbf1\) and the radial direction \(u\) (the latter is collapsed by the radial normalization).
% G: By killing the 𝑢 u-direction, LayerNorm throws away “how much” the features deviate from the mean and keeps only “in what relative proportions” they deviate.
% G: could emphasize that the radial direction u is specific for every h, but the mean centering is global.

\paragraph{Interpretation for dynamics}
LayerNorm is therefore a structured \emph{many-to-one} nonlinear map: it (i) removes one linear degree of freedom (the mean), (ii) collapses the radial coordinate in the centered hyperplane (folding onto a compact manifold), and (iii) applies an anisotropic linear rescaling and shift.
% G: (ii) is too much
% In dynamical terms this provides a strong folding/bounding operation; any stretching/expansion must come from the other components (linear layers, attention, pointwise nonlinearities) for the overall layer-to-layer map to exhibit expansion+folding behavior.
% G: I'm not sure if this is sound. why call it a folding when it is rather a projection


\subsection{Analogy and Limitations}
We propose viewing the autoregressive process of an LLM as a high-dimensional, discrete-time dynamical system. The sequence of hidden states serves as the trajectory evolving in the model's embedding space. The self-attention mechanism acts as a (state-dependent) nonlinear coupling between different tokens. 
% Each token's representation is affected by (previous) other tokens, with softmax, ReLU, layer norm providing the nonlinearity.

This is handled by expanding the phase space to include those as well growing up to $\mathbb{R}^{D \times \text{context\_size}}$. The equivalent in chaos theory is a delay system where the phase space can be infinite-dimensional. We believe this makes the discussion unnecessarily less clear, so the reader should keep this in mind, but we will not speak in this terms. We will return to this point when discussing methods to calculate distance between trajectories using sliding windows.} \\ % todo: this footnote does not appear in the text.

\label{tab:analogy}
\end{table}
% G: could add stretching and folding. table too big rn


However, the analogy is not perfect and has critical limitations. LLM dynamics are discrete, not continuous, with a fixed "time step" of one token. The act of sampling a token from the probability distribution to generate the next token can be seen as a "collapse" or a sharp discontinuity in the trajectory's evolution \footnote{The hidden states at the first layer are also discrete and correspond exactly to a column of the embedding matrix. In deeper layers, the possible hidden states are more numerous (and effectively continuous), as they are generated through nonlinear transformations (transformer layers) of the previous hidden representations.}.

% G: can clarify that it matters in that this new token is the starting point for the processing in the 1st layer, but all the previous hidden states remain and will influence at each layer.
LLMs are usually used with probabilistic sampling, which adds a random component and makes it non-deterministic. Furthermore, the dimensionality of the state space is extraordinarily high (thousands of dimensions), which poses significant challenges for traditional chaos analysis techniques.

% G: also in chaotic systems the nonlinear coupling is between variables, but in llm it is between tokens, which would be the state of the system (so all the variables) at different times

% G: as i understand it. MLP provides nonlinearity, attention nonlinear coupling and (maybe) stretching. normalization keeps the system bounded (folding). layer norm is more like projecting to the plane perpendicular to (1,1,1,..,1) plus affine rescale.

% G: is normalization folding or stretching? normalize would siggest constraining so folding, but attention is cross communication so also folding. talk this out and dicuss. which processes in LLM constrain and maintain boudedness? is this folding? which stretch= is stretching individual?

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Initial Condition Generation}
To test for sensitivity to initial conditions, we generate a set of trajectories from infinitesimally close starting points. We begin with a single prompt, tokenize it, and retrieve its initial embedding tensor $\mathbf{E}_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times D}$, where $L$ is the prompt length and $D$ is the model's hidden dimension. We then create a "blob" of $N$ perturbed initial conditions by adding a small, random perturbation tensor $\in \mathbb{R}^{L \times D}$ of fixed magnitude (radius $r$). Then we use LLM to continue each trajectory.
% G: idk if perturbation is the best word here. disturbance?

\subsection{Trajectory Distance Metrics}
We use a suite of metrics to quantify the divergence between pairs of trajectories, $\mathbf{X} = (\mathbf{x}_1, ..., \mathbf{x}_n)$ and $\mathbf{Y} = (\mathbf{y}_1, ..., \mathbf{y}_m)$. Distance between vector representations of text encode meaning about its semantic similarity \cite{text2vec} \cite{reimers2019sentencebertsentenceembeddingsusing} .
% G: cite word2vec and some paper with clustering from LLM or show my clustering. also some from text2vec embedders
% G: also mention that some metrics are based on other metrics: like rank eigen uses cos similarity to compare pairs of vectors. check which use L2
% We justify the use of cosine similarity as it is a meaningful metric both in the hidden state and embedded text space.

\subsubsection{Vector-wise Metrics}
These metrics are applied pointwise between corresponding vectors of two trajectories, yielding a time series of distance values.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cosine Distance:} Measures the angle between two vectors, capturing their orientation similarity. It is widely used to compare similarity between vector embeddings \footnote{If all vectors are normalized, cosine distance and Euclidean distance are monotonically related, so they produce the same relative ordering of pairwise similarities even though their numerical values differ. Empirically the results obtained are very similar.}. It is defined as $1 - \text{Cosine Similarity}$:
    \begin{equation}
        d_{cos}(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) = 1 - \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\|}
    \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Normalized Cross-Correlation:} Measures the similarity between two vectors as a function of the displacement of one relative to the other. For discrete vectors at zero lag, it is related to the cosine similarity. (GGG improve use formula)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Trajectory-wise Metrics}
These metrics yield a single scalar value for the distance between two entire trajectories. To obtain a divergence curve, we apply these metrics in a sliding window of increasing size. For these, we used Euclidean distance within each.
% G: maybe explain how using sliding window is like saying that the state of the system is not described by a single hidden state (or token), but by the context too (similar too delay systems)
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) \cite{SalvadorChan2007}:} Finds an optimal non-linear alignment between two sequences. It computes a cost matrix where $C_{i,j}$ is the distance between $\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\mathbf{y}_j$. The DTW distance is the value in the final cell of an accumulated cost matrix $D$, defined by the recurrence:
    \begin{equation}
        D_{i,j} = C_{i,j} + \min(D_{i-1, j}, D_{i, j-1}, D_{i-1, j-1})
    \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Fréchet Distance \cite{Denaxas2023} \cite{EiterMannila1994}:} Intuitively, the minimum length of a leash needed to connect a person and a dog walking along their respective paths. It is sensitive to the ordering of points. For two curves $P$ and $Q$, it is:
    \begin{equation}
        d_F(P, Q) = \inf_{\alpha, \beta} \max_{t \in [0,1]} \| P(\alpha(t)) - Q(\beta(t)) \|
    \end{equation}
    where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are non-decreasing reparameterizations. (GGG am i reparametrizing)
    \item \textbf{Hausdorff Distance \cite{SciPyDirectedHausdorff}:} Measures the greatest of all distances from a point in one set to the closest point in the other set. It is a pure set-based distance.
    \begin{equation}
        d_H(X, Y) = \max \left( \sup_{\mathbf{x} \in X} \inf_{\mathbf{y} \in Y} \|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\|, \sup_{\mathbf{y} \in Y} \inf_{\mathbf{x} \in X} \|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\| \right)
    \end{equation}
    % G: wasserstein not included. but maybe i wont use it
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Structural Metric} % GGG find better name. maybe put into appendix
We also defined a new distance metric based on the structural similarity of two trajectories. It showed similar results to the other metrics but it was noisier.
\begin{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{SVD Eigenvector Ranking Deviation:} We perform a PCA on each trajectory obtaining the principal directions (eigenvectors $V^{(i)}$ of the centered data covariance matrices) for each trajectory. To compare the two sets of eigenvectors, we compute the cosine similarity matrix.
    \[
    S_{ab} = \frac{v^{(1)}_a \cdot v^{(2)}_b}{\|v^{(1)}_a\| \|v^{(2)}_b\|}
    \]
    where $v^{(1)}_a$ and $v^{(2)}_b$ are the $a$-th and $b$-th eigenvectors of the first and second trajectory, respectively.

    For each eigenvector $v^{(1)}_a$, we find the index $b^*$ of the most similar eigenvector in the second trajectory:
    \[
    b^* = \arg\max_b S_{ab}
    \]

    We can show the ranking of eigenvectors to show how similar two trajectories are. The closer to the proportionality line, the more similar two trajectories.
    % plot: diagonal.png

    To get a distance scalar, we sum the cosine distances for these matched pairs \footnote{We also tried calculating the root mean square deviation with respect to the proportionality line but it was a worse metric GGG}:
    \[
    D_{\text{sum\_cos\_dist}} = \sum_{a=1}^k \left[1 - S_{a b^*}\right]
    \]
    where $D_{\text{sum\_cos\_dist}}$ is the scalar metric quantifying the dissimilarity between the two trajectories.

    \textbf{Symmetry:} This metric is \emph{not symmetric}. Matching is performed from the eigenvectors of the first trajectory to those of the second, and the assignment is not necessarily reciprocal. That is, $D_{\text{sum\_cos\_dist}}(X^{(1)}, X^{(2)}) \neq D_{\text{sum\_cos\_dist}}(X^{(2)}, X^{(1)})$ in general. We compute both and average the two (GGG).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Recurrence Analysis}
We generate Recurrence Plots (RPs) using the self-similarity matrix of a single hidden state trajectory with all the distance metrics (GGG "all distance metrics). We analyze the plots qualitatively and quantitatively using Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) metrics, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Determinism (DET):} The percentage of recurrence points forming diagonal lines, indicating predictability.
    \item \textbf{Laminarity (LAM):} The percentage of recurrence points forming vertical lines, indicating periods of stable or "laminar" states.
    \item \textbf{Entropy (ENT):} The Shannon entropy of the distribution of diagonal line lengths, reflecting the complexity of the deterministic structure.
\end{itemize} % G: include only the ones I actually use
% G: could show example how cos sim matrix is calculated and the shape for clarity




\subsection{Dimensionality}
We estimate the correlation dimension ($D_2$) of the trajectories using the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm \cite{GRASSBERGER1983189} \footnote{Other methods such as box dimension or Hausdorff dimension are less robust and harder to compute in higher dimensions}. This technique can be used to distinguish between deterministic chaos and random noise, and it is closely related to the fractal and information dimension. This can be calculated from the self-similarity matrix by applying different thresholds (which correspond to the distance $\epsilon$). 
% G: expand. mention that when T != 0, the fits are bad, but T = 0 (at last layer), fit is good. correlation dimension can be used to identify  deterministic (chaotic) systems.

% G: At the first layer, the curve is not as continuous, which can be explained by the fact that the tokens in the first layer are discrete and taken from the embedding matrix.

\subsection{Clustering}

Furthermore, we apply clustering algorithms to the set of hidden state vectors within a trajectory to identify distinct operational states or regions in the model's high-dimensional phase space.
% G: probably eliminate

% G: either do an Experiments section or here I need to conretely explain what I did: model choice, params, dim, fix length generation, context window, etc...
\subsection{Experiments}

For this study we

% G: explain what the architecture particulars of deepseekr1 entail for chaos and recurrence. reasoning

We run the model on a Tesla T4 GPU, and we obtain the generated tokens, text and hidden staes at all the layers, i.e., the representations after each transformer block \footnote{The shape of the complete hidden state tensor for a given response is (number of layers, numberof tokens, hidden dimension)}.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Trajectory Divergence and Lyapunov} \label{res:lyapunov} % GGG 

There were some challenges inherent to the system under study. In any bounded (GGG) system, there is a maximum possible value for the distance, and the distance between two diverging trajectories will eventually reach the maximum and saturate. In our case, especially when using sentence embeddings, the number of datapoints until the saturation region was often small (GGG around 6), making any type of curve fitting difficult.
% G: am i using the word bounded properly?

We see that the trajectories remain extremely close for some steps until they suddenly diverge (GGG). So the initial perturbation remains latent in the hidden states, but does not express itself immediatly in the tokens until a certain step, where the sampled token by two trajectories is different, which then leads them to quickly diverge.

\subsection{RP}

Strong similarities can be seen between the RP from the Lorenz \cite{DeterministicNonperiodicFlow} system as seen in Fig. \ref{XXX} and from the LLMs output. % GGG

As pointwise dimension is calculated from RP, it makes sense that they agree on this.
Chaotic features in recurrence plots are more present in the last layers of the model. 
% G: not always at the last layer, but also middle layers are quite chaotic

Chaotic features are more strongly present at the last layers of the LLM as showed in the RP and pointwise dimension. This is due to the progressive addition of more nonlinearity and coupling at each layer.

\subsection{Dimensionality}

% plot: cosine_sim_first_first.png and cosine_sim_last_last_LONG.png

% random at first layer is because it doesn't have all the info of the context so it appears random.
% only at last layers can you see the true chaoicity

% In the cases investigated the correlation dimension obtained using the L2 distance metric was aproximately twice the one obtained using cosine similarity.

The measured dimension value obtained varied significantly depending on the distance metric used, % GGG
while in every case, the Corrleation Dimension vs Threshold curve was similar, but with a different slope. This leads

% G: it would be great to show if last layers have a lower dimension, which could imply more "compression" of the data
% G: try to relate the dimension here with information compression, which is something super important that LLMs do.  

\section{Conclusions and Discussion}

% \subsection{Possible Explanations for LLMs being chaotic}

% (rough) invariance for different metrics {hausdorf, frechet, dtw} (and also embedders). discuss. they literally look the same. I mean to be fair the data is the same. quite trivial

This study was limited in studying a single LLM model, while we expect interesting results if this was done with other models and architectures. Certain architectural features of the model, such as the Chain-of-Thought reasoning could be recognized in the recurrence plots.

% mention the challenges and successes with high dim data. also distance metrics. and the ones I invented



% G: Try to frame some of the challenges and difficulties as interesting things
% - finding a good distance metric is tricky. it seems like each token (and its hidden state) is representing mainly that token's meaning, and not the whole state of the system (or trajectory) up until that point. In order to really describe the state of the system, we need the previous tokens too (like in the case of a delay system in chaos and nonlinear systems). The usage of sliding windows and/or sentence embedder for the distance metrics does something like this (capturing local context), and the fact that it makes the distance curves much better shows how important the context is
% this point is quite imporatnt for divergence, but not so necessary (or convenient) for RP

\section{Appendix }

\subsection{Intuition behind different metrics}

In order to gain a more intuitive understanding of each metric (GGG and maybe embedding too), we show RP from the same trajectory.


% G: Here i want to show how embeddings kind of do some averaging and pooling and context, and how some metrics pick up different features, some more global some more detail. 
% G: mention window size

\subsection{Handling outliers} % G: if this section is brief, I can include it directly in each subsection in results/methods

In section \ref{res:lyapunov} there were some initially nearby trajectories which remained close to each other and did not diverge, having the same text output and almost identical hidden states. This represented aproximately GGG 10\% of the pairs of trajectories.

\subsection{Dimensionality of the LLM vocabulary}


We also did this analysis on the embedding and unembedding matrix, which for the LLM model we use is the same. This matrix represents the vocabulary of the model, and it is not a trajectory. 
The reason we did this is because of the large number of datapoints available (around 150 thousand) without requiring any computation, and that it could provide insights into the structure of the vocabulary space. It is interesting to see that the results are different from those obtained from the analysis done on the trajectories, or what is obtained from a random set of vectors. The value obtained for the correlation dimension is smaller than expected.
% G: I don't have a good explanation or much to say here

% plot: embedding_matrix_correltion_dimension_L2_first.png and embedding_matrix_correltion_dimension_L2_second.png
% caption should include: Left: Correlation Dimension = 1.2, Right: Correlation Dimension = 5.4


\subsection{Ideas that Failed} % G: under development. maybe wont be in paper
In this section, we quickly mention a few ideas that did not work to prevent others from making the same mistake.

We also investigated the effect of temperature

We also used the wasserstein metric for the data analysis but it was noisy and not very informative.

We also used cross-recurrence plots to compare two trajectories, but found it not so clear. To compare different trajectories we prefered the methods explained in the paper.

Inspired by \cite{DONNER_2011} and \cite{Donner_2010} \cite{ZOU20191} we did the recurrence analysis using complex networks, which comes naturally by considering the recurrence matrix as the adjacency matrix of the network. While interesting, we found the results easier to analyze using RQA than this method. % G: improve



\subsection{Limitations and shortcomings of this study (GGG this won't be in the paper in this form, I just want to keep track of these):}
- i can't explain what the value of the dimension obtained *means*. if the dimensionality thing just shows that the system is deterministic, then it is quite trivial
- i only qualitatively compared the recurrence plots obtained
- i failed at aggregating results from pairs of trajectories (so far)
- the recurrence plots for different prompts are quite different and not all look chaotic
- i only did english prompts
- RQA done on different layers does not show enormous differences (although i claim that the last layers are more chaotic than the first layer). specifically
- when i generate the initial conditions I was a bit stupid and just added a fixed-magnitude random-direction perturbation. So I did not really measure the initial distance between trajectories, and i did not really measure it. I should have done a hyper equilateral triangle, but i did a hyper sphere.
- i did not really show a strange attractor, i just hint at it. i could not quantitatively compare the results for different prompts (or even for the same prompt but disturbed) in the RP and dimension stuff. One might ask: if you say that you get a sort of strange attractor, is it the same for different prompts? is there any similarity between them?. My answer would be: i dont know
- relatively short trajectories:
Using a model with so few parameters and having to limit the context window size significantly, it was difficult to make long
Due to memory constraints we had in the GPUs available, there was a tradeoff between the length of the generated text, and the model size and context window. This meant that we either had to do short responses (~3096 tokens long GGG), or if we wanted longer ones, we needed to use a smaller model or a smaller context window, which then caused the output quality to degrade, often resulting in the model getting stuck in a repetitive loop. The fact that the temperature was set to zero did not help.
What we did is use the smallest model and context window size possible while retaining a good quality output text by reading through them \footnote{also recurrence plots at a glance show if a model gets stuck in a repetitive loop}. 
We did not think this repetitive loops were worth exploring, since these are a feature which appears in very basic and small LLMs with a short context window and zero temperature, and state of the art models will overcome this.
