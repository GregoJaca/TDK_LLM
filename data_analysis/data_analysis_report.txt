Data Analysis Quality Report

## Overall Assessment

The data analysis pipeline is well-structured and the metric implementations are generally of high quality. The code is clean, modular, and respects the design principles outlined in the project documentation. The existing metrics are robust and provide a good starting point for analyzing LLM hidden-state trajectories.

## Metric-Specific Analysis

- **Cosine Similarity (`cos.py`):** Robust implementation with a useful shifting mechanism.
- **Cross-Correlation (`cross_corr.py`):** Correct and robust implementation of Pearson and Spearman correlation on cosine similarity matrices.
- **Cross-Cosine Similarity (`cross_cos.py`):** An interesting metric that provides a 2D view of the similarity between two trajectories. The sliding window implementation is reasonable.
- **Dynamic Time Warping (`dtw_fast.py`):** Good use of `fastdtw` for performance, with a fallback to `tslearn` for exactness.
- **Fréchet Distance (`frechet.py`):** The fallback to a pure Python implementation is a good feature for availability, but it is slow.
- **Hausdorff Distance (`hausdorff.py`):** Standard and reliable implementation. The sliding window heuristic is reasonable.
- **Rank Eigenvector (`rank_eigen.py`):** A complex and powerful metric that appears to be correctly implemented.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1.  **Configurable Cosine Shift Aggregation:** The aggregation method for shifted cosine distances is hardcoded. Allow the user to select the aggregation method (e.g., `mean`, `min`, `max`) in `config.py`.

2.  **Fréchet Distance Performance:** The pure Python implementation of discrete Fréchet distance is a performance bottleneck. Consider implementing a faster version using Cython or exploring alternative algorithms.

3.  **Hausdorff Sliding Window Aggregation:** The current sliding window aggregation for Hausdorff distance uses the maximum of the mean distances. Investigate other aggregation strategies, such as the mean of the maximum distances, for potentially more robust results.

## Suggested Additional Metrics and Techniques

1.  **Gromov-Wasserstein Distance:** This metric is suitable for comparing datasets of different sizes and is robust to differences in the number of points. It would be a valuable addition for comparing trajectories of different lengths.

2.  **Procrustes Analysis:** Use Procrustes analysis to align trajectories before comparison. This would remove global rotational, translational, and scaling differences, allowing for a more direct comparison of the trajectories' shapes.

3.  **Topological Data Analysis (TDA):** Apply TDA techniques, such as persistent homology, to extract topological features from the trajectories. This would provide a novel way to compare trajectories that is robust to noise and deformations.
